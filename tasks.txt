Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to implement source resistance for Collector Feedback (and maybe for the rest)
3. Add source resistance seen by circuit at the input
    - Expand Resistor class and Constructor

DONE
Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to store frequency dependent data, so it can be plotted
4. Store samples in collection so it can be passed to a Plot interface
    - Create vector for storing data

DONE
Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to calculate resistors in parallel without passing array pointer and its size
5. Store resistances in dynamically allocated array
    - Use vector instead of array

DONE
Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to all dynamically allocated objects become smart pointers for safety reason
6. Change raw pointers into smart pointers
    - Use unique_pointer and make_unique

SUSPENDED
Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to implement Common Emitter Collector Feedback amplifier
7. Do math
    - as above

Engineering Story: As an Engineer, I want to calculate data for different types of filtering
8. Do formulas for filters: HP, LP, first and second order, active and passive
    - Store magnitude in a hash map
